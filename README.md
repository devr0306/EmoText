## Overview
This app is a Machine Learning based messaging app which uses Natural Language processing to detect the emotions of a user through the last few texts he/she sent to others. Using that information, friends of the user can have an idea of how to approach the person.

## Technologies
* This app's frontend is written in Android Studio, and uses 2 main languages: Java and XML. XML is used for the entire design and layout of the app, while Java is responsible for the responsiveness of the GUI generated by the XML files.

* The backend uses JavaScript, Node.js, and Socket.io for the backend, along with PostgreSQL databases. All of these are used with Docker containers. All the API's for the app have been made by us, and are in another GitHub repository.

* Technologies like Flask and Python, with libraries like Pandas and Numpy, are used for the Machine Learning part of the app.

* We are also making an iOS app which uses the same backend, but with technologies such as Swift, SwiftUI, and XCode.

The sign up activity consists of more fields. It starts off with the email, followed by an email code the user will receive. After that, the final 4 fields will be username, email, password, and confirm password, along with a place to pick a profile picture. After entering everything, the user can advance to the main activity.

### Main
This will be a swipable main activity consisting of 3 tabs: People, Camera, and Chats. This activity will have a bar at the top consisting of 3 items: the profile picture of the user, which can direct him/her to the User Info Activity, a search bar, and a button which will direct the user to the Add Friends Activity.
